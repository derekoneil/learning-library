In order to complete the remaining migration labs, we will first create our on-prem application.  We have a pre-created image with an embeded Weblogic Server which will be used for this process.  To import this image, we must first create a network (VNC) that will allow you access into your image and a compartment which will contain your instances.


### **STEP 3**: Create Network and Compartment on OCI
- Click Computer from the Customize Dashboard, and Click Identy and Compartments.
